# SignIn-and-SignUp
I have created SignUp and SignIn page individually and after that i have integrated both pages along with a simple home page. I have connected both signup and signin with Local storage so we can store the new user data from signup page to local storage so after during the signin we can fetch the data from local storage for signIn to home page
